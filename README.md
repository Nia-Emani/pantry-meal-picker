### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Styled using Flexbox or Grid.
- Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
- Implement responsive design using at least one media query/breakpoint (i.e. desktop, tablet, mobile, etc).
- Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
- Deployed site to a hosting service like Github Pages.
- Make commits to GitHub every day.
- A README.md file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i.

#### PostMVP  

- Add second API for cocktail suggestions for each meal
- Add recipe links for each displayed meal
